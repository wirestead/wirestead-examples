Practical examples for using Wirestead in real-world C++ communication
scenarios.

This repository demonstrates how to build TCP, UDP, Serial, and Unix Domain
Socket applications using Wirestead's unified async communication interface.

## What is Wirestead?

Wirestead is a modern C++ communication library that provides a unified
interface for serial, network, and local IPC transports.

Core library:
https://github.com/wirestead/wirestead

## Examples

| Category | Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [TCP](examples/tcp/) | sync / async | Basic TCP client/server communication |
| [UDP](examples/udp/) | sync / async | Datagram-based communication |
| [UDS](examples/uds/) | sync / async | Unix Domain Socket local IPC |
| [Serial](examples/serial/) | sync / async | Serial communication examples |

Example sources live under `examples/` and preserve the transport-focused
layout from the core repository.

## Build

### Option 1: Build without installing Wirestead

This is the quickest path for trying the examples. CMake fetches Wirestead
v0.9.0 as configured in `cmake/FetchWirestead.cmake`.

```bash
cmake --preset fetchcontent
cmake --build --preset fetchcontent
```

This mode requires network access during the first configure step.

### Option 2: Use vcpkg

Use this with a vcpkg checkout that provides the canonical `wirestead` port.
The examples prefer `wiresteadConfig.cmake` and fall back to the legacy
`unilinkConfig.cmake` package only when an installed compatibility package is
available.

```bash
cmake --preset vcpkg
cmake --build --preset vcpkg
```

Set `VCPKG_ROOT` to your vcpkg checkout path before running this command. Until
the official registry includes `wirestead`, use a vcpkg checkout or overlay that
contains the new port, or skip this preset during local validation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg "$VCPKG_ROOT"
"$VCPKG_ROOT/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh"
```

### Option 3: Use a local Wirestead source checkout

Use this when you already have the core repository locally and want to avoid
downloading it again.

```bash
cmake --preset fetchcontent \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_WIRESTEAD=/path/to/wirestead
cmake --build --preset fetchcontent
```

### Option 4: Use an installed Wirestead package

```bash
WIRESTEAD_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/wirestead/install cmake --preset installed
cmake --build --preset installed
```

Installed-package mode assumes Wirestead and its exported dependencies are
discoverable by CMake, typically via `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or a system install
location. Wirestead v0.9.x resolves its exported dependencies from
`wiresteadConfig.cmake`, so consumers do not need to call `find_package(spdlog)`
before `find_package(wirestead CONFIG REQUIRED)`.

## Run

Binaries are generated under the selected preset's build directory:

```text
build/<preset>/bin
```

Examples:

```bash
./build/fetchcontent/bin/sync_tcp_echo_server
./build/fetchcontent/bin/sync_tcp_echo_client
./build/fetchcontent/bin/async_udp_receiver
./build/fetchcontent/bin/sync_uds_echo_server
./build/fetchcontent/bin/sync_serial_echo
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for the full binary list and
transport-specific run commands.

## Notes

- TCP and UDP examples can usually be run locally.
- UDS examples are supported on Unix-like platforms.
- Serial examples may require an available serial device or loopback setup.

## Tested With

- CMake 3.28
- GCC 13
- Wirestead v0.9.0
- vcpkg package `wirestead` 0.9.0
- Installed-package mode with a local Wirestead v0.9.x install prefix
